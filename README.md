# C# Github Codespaces trial

This is a repository to make some expirements with Github Codespaces and C#.

It is working perfectly with 

    dotnet new webapp
    dotnet new blazorwasm

You can also launch the applications and see the results in your own browser!

The Blazor Web Assembly single page application is built using [Github Actions](https://github.com/laurentkempe/csharpcodespacetrial/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml) and deployed to Github pages on my [Blog](http://laurentkempe.com/csharpcodespacetrial/).
